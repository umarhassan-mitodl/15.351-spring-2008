Competitive implications of market and technology dynamics ({{% resource_link 717e7954-77a0-0caf-9f51-10782799db72 "PDF" %}})
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


1\. How do market and technology evolution provide opportunities for entrepreneurs?  
2\. What types of changes in competition are driven by technological and market dynamics?  
3\. Is disruption a useful way to think about these dynamics? What does it really mean – what is the definition that Christensen uses? How is it different from the idea of radical innovation?  
4\. Why do some of these opportunities lead to a wave of successful start-ups, for example the hard disk drive industry analyzed by Christensen, while others, such as the TV opportunity that Gladwell describes (The Televisionary) lead to failed entrepreneurship?

Systematizing innovation; "What's the Big Idea;" IDEO ({{% resource_link 936b6711-eb2e-2129-07da-56ec8f489235 "PDF" %}})
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


1\. Is innovation about individuals or groups?  
2\. Do you think it is possible to build an organization to systematically come up with new innovations? What processes would it need to have?  
3\. Referring to the case, why does BIG seem better able to identify and bring to market innovative toy concepts, whereas the major toy companies feel they are in a period of a "lack of innovation" (p. 3)?  
4\. How proprietary or defensible is BIG's system? Could one of the major toy companies replicate it? Why or why not?  
5\. Can BIG replicate its system in other industries such as your own?
